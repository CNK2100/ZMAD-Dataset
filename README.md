#  ZMAD Devices Traffic Dataset

This is the dataset used in the paper:" ZMAD: Lightweight Model-based Anomaly Detection for the Structured Z-Wave Protocol".

The dataset can be used to test cybersecurity applications, Ai-based IDS, threat intelligence, adversarial machine learning that target the Z-Wave protocol.

ZMAD dataset includes heterogenous real Z-Wave devices traffic such as the Main controller, several slaves devices, actuators, sensors, etc. 

The dataset consist of normal(benign) traffic and abnormal (attack) traffic collected from known Z-Wave vulnerabilities and fuzzing techniques.

For the academic/public use of the dataset, the authors have to cite the following paper:

1. C. K. Nkuba, S. Woo, H. Lee, and S. Dietrich, "ZMAD: Lightweight Model-based Anomaly Detection for the Structured Z-Wave Protocol," in IEEE Access, 2023.
